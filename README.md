# Personal-Webpage-with-Basic-CSS-and-HTML
This is a personal webpage of myself for an assignment in university.

If you want to run the application.
1)Create a single folder and put all the files in there
2)After that, just run the index.html

It is as simple as that.

The contact page which is index4.html is not sending the form anywhere,it is just there for looks.
